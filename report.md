## Best Practices

1. Minimum length of 14 characters recommended.
2. Combine uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
3. Use a reputable password manager.
4. Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA).
5. Avoid:

   * Common words or phrases
   * Predictable sequences
   * Personal data (names, birthdays)

## Common Attack Methods

* **Brute Force**: Exhaustive guessing of all combinations.
* **Dictionary Attacks**: Testing common words and variations.
* **Credential Stuffing**: Using leaked passwords on multiple services.

## Recommendations

* Use password managers to create and store unique, complex passwords.
* Always enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for added security.
* Never reuse the same password across different sites.
* Update passwords immediately if you suspect a breach.
